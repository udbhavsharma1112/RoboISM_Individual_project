PROBLEM FACED: 
This project is all about the safety of new drivers and for those who drives at nights (ex. Truck drivers).
Some time in driving schools or at home when beginners learn driving cars, they have not much control on brake, clutch and accelerator, and it is mostly seen that they press accelerator in place of clutch or brake. It may lead to an accident.
 Also at night many accidents happen because of the driver's sleep as a result car or truck collides with dividers or any other vehicle.


SOLUTION: 
I am going to use ultrasonic sensors to measure the distance between objects and cars. When the distance between them is in the range of 20m to 10m(in prototype, it is 20cm to 10cm)  the alarm starts ringing and the LEDs start blinking. But when the distance between them is less than 10m(in prototype,it is 10cm), an emergency brake is applied automatically and car stops before collide to any object.
